        <h2>1. PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE</h2>

        <h3>What is Purrify?</h3>
        <p>Purrify is a premium activated coconut carbon odor eliminator designed specifically for cat litter boxes. It provides chemical-free, natural odor control that keeps homes fresh for up to 7 days.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>How Activated Coconut Carbon Works</h3>
            <p><strong>The Science Made Simple:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Porous Structure:</strong> Coconut carbon has millions of tiny pores that trap odor molecules like a sponge</li>
                <li><strong>Activation Process:</strong> Heat treatment creates an ultra-porous surface with massive absorption capacity</li>
                <li><strong>Odor Elimination:</strong> Unlike air fresheners that mask smells, Purrify actually captures and neutralizes odor molecules</li>
                <li><strong>Safe & Natural:</strong> No chemicals, fragrances, or artificial ingredients</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES</h2>

        <h3>Objection 1: "Why not just change the litter more often?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> "Great question! While regular cleaning is important, Purrify works between cleanings to neutralize odors. It actually extends the life of your litter and saves money by reducing how often you need to completely change it. Plus, it keeps your home fresh even if you're away for a few days."</p>

        <h3>Objection 2: "I already use scented litter."</h3>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> "Many cats are actually sensitive to artificial fragrances, which can deter them from using their litter box. Purrify eliminates odors naturally without any scents, making it more comfortable for your cat while still keeping your home odor-free. It works great alongside any litter you're already using."</p>

        <h3>Objection 3: "This seems expensive."</h3>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> "Let's break it down: one application lasts 7 days, and it actually reduces how much litter you use. Most customers find they save money because they're changing litter less frequently. Plus, you can't put a price on coming home to a fresh-smelling house!"</p>

        <h3>Objection 4: "Will my cat eat it or track it everywhere?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> "Purrify is formulated to stay in the litter box. The activated carbon granules are designed to mix with litter, not stick to paws. And it's 100% non-toxic, so even if your curious cat investigates, it's completely safe."</p>

        <h3>Objection 5: "Does it really work?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Response:</strong> "Activated coconut carbon is scientifically proven to absorb odors - it's the same technology used in water filtration and air purification systems. We're so confident that we offer a satisfaction guarantee. Many of our retailers have personal testimonials from customers who say they can't live without it!"</p>

        <h2>4. DEMO SCRIPT FOR CUSTOMERS</h2>

        <div class="demo-script">
            <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "Hi! Are you a cat owner? Let me show you something that'll change your life - Purrify!"</p>

            <p><strong>Problem Identification:</strong> "We all love our cats, but litter box odor is the worst part of cat ownership, right? Especially in apartments or smaller homes."</p>

            <p><strong>Product Introduction:</strong> "Purrify uses activated coconut carbon - the same technology in premium water filters - to actually eliminate odors at the molecular level, not just cover them up."</p>

            <ul>
                <li>One sprinkle lasts 7 full days</li>
                <li>100% natural - no chemicals or fragrances that might bother your cat</li>
                <li>Safe for kittens and multi-cat homes</li>
                <li>Works with whatever litter you're already using</li>
                <li>You'll actually save money because your litter lasts longer"</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Q: What's the shelf life?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> When stored in a cool, dry place with the container sealed, Purrify maintains its effectiveness for 2+ years.</p>
